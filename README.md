# Python Capstone Project

## Overview
The **Python Capstone Project** is designed to provide insights through data analysis and visualization using Python. This project leverages Python libraries to clean, analyze, and visualize data, helping businesses or researchers extract meaningful patterns and trends.

## Project Motivation
Data-driven decision-making is essential in various industries. This project demonstrates how Python can transform raw data into actionable insights using statistical analysis and visual storytelling. The aim is to explore trends, relationships, and key takeaways from the dataset.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics and trend analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Matplotlib & Seaborn to generate insightful visual representations.
- **Machine Learning (if applicable):** Predictive modeling using scikit-learn.
- **Custom Reports:** Generating insights based on structured queries and visual outputs.

## Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset:** [Mention dataset type, e.g., sales, customer transactions, etc.]
- **Data Preparation:** Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Notes:** Any assumptions, data limitations, or modifications made during preprocessing.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Main tool for analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visual representation.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models (if applicable).
